This is an imgur random image loader.  I'm not sure why this is interesting, but it started as a 10-line script that I got carried away with.  That's what side projects are for, though.  :)

TODO:
- Inifnite loading
- Make some more parameters user-adjustable
- Remove the now-pointless ruby stuff (this started as an excuse to play with sinatra but I ended up just making it all client-side)
- Reorganize.  Maybe try out ember or backbone.
